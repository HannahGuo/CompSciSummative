Culminating Task
Programming Language - Python 3.6.5
Problem Description - Roboto is a game where the player plays as a light-coloured robot (called Roboto) against a dark-
coloured robot (called Dark Roboto). The goal is for the player to hit Dark Roboto as many times as possible
before they get hit by one of Dark Roboto's shots.
Program Assumptions - This program requires a computer that has Python 3.6.5 installed. It has been tested using the
Windows 10 OS, but should also be compatible on Mac OS. It also requires the pygame module to be installed, and all
of the files that are in the Github Repository to be present.
Features of Program - This program has many features, including a Graphical User Interface (GUI), animated sprites,
a high score counter (using pickle library), various timed features (using the time library) a pause menu and a help
screen.
Restrictions - The display window cannot change size due to scaling.
Known Errors - None
Implementation Details / How to Build Programs - The user needs to download the files off of the master branch of this
project's Github repository (link in Additional Files). This can be done by having Git installed and using the git clone
command, or by downloading it as a .zip file. They also need Python 3.6.5 and the latest version of Pygame
installed. The user should then run Main.py to launch the game.
Additional Files - Every file included in the master branch of the project's Github repository, found at
